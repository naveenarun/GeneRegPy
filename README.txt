GeneRegPy - Version 1.0 README

--------TUTORIAL--------
To get you started, the software is packaged with "input.grn." This file contains the data for a simple FFL with Z as an "and" gate and Sx as the pulsed input. (There can only be one "switch" - the pulsed input - but there can be multiple "tracked" outputs.) The resulting values over time are tracked in the PyPlot window.

-------PARAMETERS-------
Make sure to tab between input parameters. This is important, since the program needs white space to separate values.
